# Some extra debugging for project developers - safe to disable, but read on why they might be useful:

# By enabling CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARIES_ONLY_TARGETS, CMake will report errors whenever
# a name that does not refer to a target known to CMake is passed to
# target_link_libraries and friends.
# We use targets for all dependencies in this project, so if a non-target name is
# passed it usually indicates a bug (usually a typo or a missing find_package call)
# in the CMake configuration.
# Example:
#   target_link_libraries(example_library PUBLIC spdlog)
# This is incorrect as spdlog is not always a target name provided by the spdlog project - it might
# exist in the project itself when it is included via FetchContent, but not if we use a system-provided
# spdlog version.
# Normally, CMake would go on to add "spdlog" as a literal library to the linker command line (e.g. -lspdlog),
# which is not what we want as it might not correct to the correct spdlog library *and* it does not ensure
# the usage requirements (include directories, definitions, other compiler options) are correctly added
# to the compiler command line for example_library.
#
# But since we have CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARIES_ONLY_TARGETS enabled, CMake will instead print an error like this:
# CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:123456 (target_link_libraries):
#   Target "example_library" has LINK_LIBRARIES_ONLY_TARGETS enabled, but it
#   links to:
#
#     spdlog
#
#   which is not a target.  Possible reasons include:
#
#     * There is a typo in the target name.
#     * A find_package call is missing for an IMPORTED target.
#     * An ALIAS target is missing.
